"""
Example: Single CrewAI Agent Server

This example demonstrates how to expose a CrewAI crew as an A2A-compliant agent.
The crew performs research tasks using multiple specialized agents.

Prerequisites:
- crewai package installed: pip install crewai
- OpenAI API key set in environment: OPENAI_API_KEY

Usage:
