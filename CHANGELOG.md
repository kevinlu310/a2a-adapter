## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.13] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Thin `a2a-adapter` command-line entry point for starting Pi, Codex, Claude,
  or OpenClaw as an A2A server from the current directory
- `-help`, `-h`, and `--help` usage output for the root command and every
  supported CLI agent
- Native agent argument passthrough after `--`, with adapter-owned protocol
  and session options protected from overrides
- `PiAdapter` for exposing one persistent Pi RPC process and durable session as
  a streaming A2A agent
- Configurable Pi source-entrypoint commands, graceful abort, context binding,
  and accepted-prompt crash protection

### Changed

- `PiAdapter`, `CodexAdapter`, `ClaudeCodeAdapter`, and `OpenClawAdapter` now
  accept argument sequences used by the thin CLI entry point
- Documentation now distinguishes the CLI use case from the Python SDK use case
- Hermes remains available through the Python SDK and is not part of the v1 CLI

## [0.2.12] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Increase subprocess `StreamReader` limit to 10 MB in `base_adapter.py` to prevent `LimitOverrunError` on large output lines

### Changed

- Remove stale development plan and tracking documents (`PLAN-hermes-a2a-adapter.md`, `openclaw/TRACKING.md`)

## [0.2.11] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- Fix Part emptiness check for missing oneof content variant

### Added

- Regression tests for Part emptiness check edge cases
- Documentation for Hermes adapter and aligned HermesAdapter example

## [0.2.10] - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- Bump version to 0.2.10

## [0.2.9] - 2026-04-22

### Breaking Changes

- Upgraded `a2a-sdk` dependency to `>=1,<2` (A2A SDK V1.0)

### Changed

- Full A2A SDK V1.0 compatibility sweep across all adapters and core infrastructure
- Migrated all adapters (Callable, CrewAI, LangChain, LangGraph, N8n, OpenClaw) to V1.0 imports and types
- Migrated core infrastructure (`adapter.py`, `client.py`, `base_adapter.py`, `executor.py`) to V1.0
- N8n adapter multimodal rewrite for V1.0 proto Part fields
- Symbol-level `ImportError` guards in `client.py` for narrower dependency checks

### Fixed

- OpenClaw adapter now handles silent completions and explicit failures in responses
- All test suites migrated to A2A SDK V1.0 types (`Part`, `TextPart`, `AgentCard.url`, async `event_queue`)

### Removed

- Development docs cleaned up

## [0.2.8] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- `HermesAdapter` — adapter for Hermes agents with streaming support, run failure propagation, and same-session request serialization
- `ClaudeCodeAdapter` and `CodexAdapter` — adapters for Claude Code and Codex CLI agents with opt-in constructor flags
- 60 new unit tests for core adapter modules
- Hermes agent adapter test suite

### Fixed

- Fix malformed `TextPart` from empty streaming chunks
- Hermes adapter: close streaming artifacts on error, propagate run failures to A2A task state

## [0.2.7] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- Downgrade "Executing OpenClaw command" log from `INFO` to `DEBUG` to reduce noise when running agents via `hybro-hub agent start`
- Fix `OllamaClient._get_client()` mock stomping: guard `is_closed` check with `isinstance(httpx.AsyncClient)` so injected test mocks are not overwritten by a real client, fixing 5 unit tests that were hitting a live Ollama instance

## [0.2.6] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- Handle OpenClaw outputting JSON to stderr instead of stdout - now checks both streams
- Fix tests for cancel/close that were missing async mock for `proc.wait()`
- Improve error message when OpenClaw command returns empty output to include stderr for debugging

## [0.2.5] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- Remove the wrong package with name a2a. Only a2a-sdk is the right A2A sdk to keep.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- Close adapter and HTTP clients on shutdown via Starlette lifespan — `adapter.close()` is now called when uvicorn shuts down
- Recreate closed HTTP clients transparently in OllamaClient, N8nAdapter, and OpenClawAdapter
- Prevent zombie processes by awaiting `proc.wait()` after `proc.kill()` in OpenClawAdapter

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-13

### Changed

- Correct default llama model name, and error out when wrong model name is provided

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- GitHub Actions workflow for automated PyPI publishing via trusted publishers
- Multimodality support for N8nAdapter (file and image handling)

### Changed

- N8nAdapter now uses `isinstance` for FilePart check and filters file/image fields from text
- N8nAdapter reuses HTTP client for better performance
- N8nAdapter returns consistent `list[Part]` in multimodal mode
- MIME types are now configurable in N8nAdapter

### Fixed

- Improved Ollama error messages with model name and parsed error detail
- Use consistent `artifact_id` for streaming chunks in executor

### Refactored

- Extracted `_to_parts()` helper in executor for cleaner code

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- `OllamaClient` — standalone HTTP client for the Ollama API (`/api/chat`), with streaming support
- `OllamaAdapter` now accepts an `OllamaClient` instance, consistent with how `LangChainAdapter` accepts a runnable and `LangGraphAdapter` accepts a graph
- `OllamaClient` exported from `a2a_adapter` and `a2a_adapter.integrations`
- Convenience constructor preserved: `OllamaAdapter(model="...")` still works for simple cases

### Changed

- `OllamaAdapter.get_metadata()` no longer leaks the model name into AgentCard `name`/`description` defaults

### Refactored

- Separated Ollama HTTP client concerns from the A2A adapter layer for cleaner architecture

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-09

### Breaking Changes

v0.1 API still works but is deprecated.

- New simplified adapter interface: `BaseA2AAdapter` with single `invoke()` method
- New server functions: `serve_agent(adapter)` and `to_a2a(adapter)` replace manual AgentCard + serve pattern
- New flat imports: `from a2a_adapter import N8nAdapter, serve_agent`

### Added

- `BaseA2AAdapter` — new abstract base with `invoke()` / `stream()` / `cancel()` / `close()`
- `AdapterMetadata` — dataclass for automatic AgentCard generation
- `AdapterAgentExecutor` — bridge layer connecting adapters to A2A SDK
- `server.py` — `to_a2a()`, `serve_agent()`, `build_agent_card()` utilities
- `load_adapter()` — new sync factory function with registry pattern
- `register_adapter()` — decorator for third-party adapter registration
- 6 new v0.2 adapter classes: `N8nAdapter`, `CallableAdapter`, `LangChainAdapter`, `LangGraphAdapter`, `CrewAIAdapter`, `OpenClawAdapter`
- Full streaming support for LangChain and LangGraph adapters
- Lazy imports for all adapter classes (optional deps only loaded on use)
- 117 new unit tests for v0.2 components

### Deprecated

- `BaseAgentAdapter` (v0.1) — use `BaseA2AAdapter`
- `load_a2a_agent()` — use `load_adapter()`
- `build_agent_app()` — use `to_a2a()`
- `client.py` — use `server.py`
- All `*AgentAdapter` classes — use new shorter names (e.g. `N8nAdapter`)

### Design

- SDK-First: delegates task management, SSE streaming, push notifications to A2A SDK
- ~85% code reduction in adapter implementations
- See `DESIGN_V0.2.md` for full architecture rationale
